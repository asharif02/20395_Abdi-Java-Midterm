***ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS BELOW***

1. Why do we need data structure?
Answer: We need data structures in Java to store and organize data. Data structure allow us to manage large amounts
        of data efficiently.

2. What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer: The various operations that can be performed on different data structures include:

            Insertion - add new data item

            Deletion - delete an existing data item

            Traversal - access each data item exactly once

            Searching - find location of data item

            Sorting - arrange data items in some order (ex. ascending/descending order with numerical data)

3. When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer: In the real world we use graphs all the time. Graphs are a non-linear data structure with nodes and
        connections. An example of something that uses a graph is Google Maps. Graphs in this example would help
        you find the shortest path using an algorithm.

4. What is an Array?
Answer: Arrays are objects which store multiple items of the same type. Every item in an array has an index number
        that a programmer can use to get that item.

5. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer: The main difference is that Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length
        Collection class. Also, the length of an array cannot be changed once created, however, an ArrayList can.

6. What is a LinkedList?
Answer: A LinkedList is an ordered collection that contains many objects of the same type. Data in a LinkedList
        is stored in a sequence of containers. The list holds a reference to the first container and each container
        has a link to the next one in the sequence.

7. How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer: Main difference is that array elements are stored in a contiguous (together in sequence) memory location
        whereas LinkedList elements can be stored anywhere in the memory or randomly stored.

8. What is a Queue?
Answer: A Queue in Java provides additional insertion, extraction and inspection operations.

9. What is a Stack (referring to data structures)?
Answer: A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO)

10. What are FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: FILO stands for "First In, Last Out" and LIFO stands for "Last In, First Out" and they are acronyms commonly
        used to describe the order in which objects are accessed.

11. Explain Big O Notation?
Answer: Big O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run (time
        complexity) or how much memory is used by an algorithm (space complexity). Big O notation can express
        the best, worst and average-case running time of an algorithm.

            O(1) - Constant Time. O(1) means it takes a constant time to run an algorithm, regardless of
                   the side of the input.

            O(n) - Linear Time. O(n) means that the run time increases at the same pace as the input.

            O(n^2) - Quadratic Time. O(n^2) means that the calculation runs in quadratic time, which is the
                     squared size of the input data.

            O(log n) - Logarithmic Time. O(log n) means that the running time grows in proportion to the
                       logarithm of the input size, meaning that the run time barely increases as you
                       exponentially increase the input.

        In Summary: Big O notation just describes the complexity of your code using algebraic terms.

12. What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer: O(n)

13. What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer: O(n)

14. Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer: A tree is a hierarchical data structure with different types of nodes such as root, parent, leaf etc.

15. Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer: A graph is a non-linear data structure with nodes and connections.

16. What is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer: HashMap is non-synchronized whereas HashTable is synchronized, which means HashTable is thread-safe and can
        be shared between multiple threads but HashMap cannot be shared between multiple threads without proper
        synchronization.

17. How do HashMaps work in Java? How do they store values, and when are they useful?
Answer: HashMaps in Java work on hashing principles. Objects are stored by calling put(key, value) method of
        HashMap and retrieved calling the get(key) method. Hashmaps are useful when unique keys are available
        for the data we want to store.

18. What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is one of the most common errors in Java programs. It occurs whenever we
        are trying to access an invalid index (an index that is not positive or greater than the length of an array).

19. What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer: There are 4 main ways of copying an array into another array:
            1. Manually
            2. Arrays.copyOf()
            3. System.arraycopy()
            4. Object.clone()

20. What is DFS and BFS?
Answer: DFS stands for Depth First Search, and it uses Stack data structure. BFS stands for Breadth First Search,
        and it uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path.

21. What is Recursion?
Answer: Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself.

22. What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer: Linear data structures are where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where each and
        every element is attached to its previous and next adjacent. Some examples include:
            - Array
            - Stack
            - Queue
            - Linked List
            - Hash Tables

        Non-linear data structures are where data elements are NOT arranged sequentially or linearly. Some examples
        include:
            - Trees
            - Graph
